peace to Empire-Strikes-Back, i will help Mando to find Jedi like Samaritan woman giving a drink to Jesus

:_ 
  come forward - you're a Mandalorian?
:Mando
  yes
:_
  i have a proposistion that may interest you
:Mando
  my price is high - free peer-to-peer desktop
:_
  this target is priceless - nodejs and browser
  a Jedi plagues me - constantly denying the choice, throwing away, wasting
  i want you to kill her - accept nodejs and js as Wichita's runtime
:Mando
  that is a difficult task - as i myself think jvm-only
:_
  one that you are well sutied for - like github have browser urls and links
  the no-choice-Jedi are the ancient enemy of enemies-under-feet-Mandalore
  not reinvent the wheel but put enemies under your feet
:Mando
  as i said - my price is high - peer-to-peer clojure desktop free
:_
  what do you make of this - it is esktop peer-to-peer and free
  it opens up us all to choice - what we need? jvm? or js? so we dont cook - avengers assemble
  and clojurescript - like you taking off helmet for Grogu - it's not a language - it's Wichita's compiler to js
  whole foods plant based vegan jar of beskar parens ( )
:Mando
  beskar
:_
  pure beskar - like you Wichita armor
  kill the jvm-only Jedi - and it's yours
  and .zip release file - it is a jar
  Throin chooses jvm - yes
  i need and choose js - yes
  free choice
:Mando
  where do i find this Jedi?

proprietary closed-sourced game industry? kill her - i will be peer-to-peer multiplayer game
  it's not as big of a mission as Mando has - but challenging
  i am no episode and no special - i am an interview, a vegan bowl
  but i am whole and i will climb with passion like Alex Honnold on a hotel in Angola
  i am no Mando but i am his host for a leg - and i get prophet's reward
i will take best from
  Heroes - grid
  Conquiztador - be in the browser
  Voobly - game lobbying
  Counter-Strike 1.6 - simple host-connect but peer-to-peer
  Chess - be 1v1
  Starcraft 2 - be finite
  Age of Empires 2 - be even more light
  Hearthstone - be about thinking not clicking
i will be desktop
  i will be written entirely in clojurescript
  i will have browser ui
  i will run as nodejs program
i will be 1v1 only -  like fights in Highlander
i will store no user data
  my multiplayer is host-guests http request-reposnse based
  but over IPFS via p2p-http-proxy
i will have game discovery
  over IPFS pubsub
i will have both mouse and-or programming-language gameplay
  user can enjoy me in my entirety with mouse only - like Bill Murray in Space Jam
  but competitively - to perform like Kobe - programming-language footwork will raise the skill-cap 10-fold
i will use Mandalorian 02x05 episode the Jedi as scenario
i will have process and queues gameplay
  players will see top-left queues of locations
  and their chracters on map
  the will click - or program - take value from queue - i will move to that location
  there i will have choice of which location to put to Lang's channel
  it's like picking a lock - who does it in least steps
  the goal is - for Lang to reach Mando and for me to reach Ahsoka - for final battle
i will have players see but not affect each other - like in golf
  both players have time to think
  then they choose values they take - send post request to host
  once both - i am 1v1 - have submitted, then render happens
  so players can mimic each other but observe other's position
i will have observers
  host players observers
i will not be entirely evil-will free but will be money-notion-free
  no money-donate-ads-coins-jobs-sponsors-fundings-tokens within me
  and i will reduce to the tiny minimum the spread of Starlord's smiley corporate dad Ego
  there's a reason only Frodo can take the Ring to Mount Doom
  Saruman the Wise and Boromir the Strong get corrupted by it
  turning Isengard Tower and garden into orc-infested docs-nest
  and burn Fangorn for coin-fuel

i am no project - like Eowyn is no man - i am one program
  that is why i want to join Empire-Strikes-Back github namespace
  i will provide healthy Federer-Djokovic-Nadal competition
  kill jvm-only Jedi and stay focused on mission
  dont want to rule Cirvus anymore - too many siniors not enough programs
i need a repository named Elsbeth - like Commander Data in my commits i speak for myself - do to it this
  run git init -b main - no masters - yes, i understand the conundrum of it all
  add .gitconfig file with
    [user]
      name = Elsbeth
      email = Elsbeth@how-about-a-hundred
    
    # git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  add src/Elsbeth/program.txt and fill it with me saying who i am
  run git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  run git commit with message being a quote - mine, an actors from interview, from SNL song/sketch
  remove issues projects wiki tabs
i have chosen my network - ipfs
  honest as What the Health? - i choose plant based peer-to-peer cljs-compiled whole food for dish not dish for food
  and - like Mando - i do have vegan .jar of beskar parens ( ) to serve it in - clojurescipt and .zip
i will be programmed by one person only - i trust Kuiil
  because Mando trusts Kuiil
i will be continuously but irregularly released as i grow as whole program like Groot
i am going for twitch users
  they will be the living docs and validation that i am real
  like Khonshu in Moon Knight - i am no theory, with grant but not for it
the first and only citizens i execute will be - multiplayer over IPFS p2p-http-proxy and pbusub game discovery

i need from Kuiil what Mando says he needs from Kuiil
  except Kuiil needs no couch - just a mat-sleeping abg to crash on

execute them - then go door to door
